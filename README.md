- 👋 Hi, I’m @chillpill13
- 👀 I’m interested in building PCs and programming on them (occasionally) as well as web development and working with media (pictures, video/audo (Photoshop/Premere Pro)). I'm also into firearms and build them, but that's pretty unrelated to this site.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to redo basic HTML5 and PHP (not coding but still... it's been awhile) as well as learning code. I'm good (or used to be) in Photoshop, but was still leaning Premere Pro at the time...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm not entirely sure yet but I will figure something out.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: chillpill1@hotmail.com; Steam: chillpill1; Discord: chillpill#0013
